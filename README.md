# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a dataset from a bikesharing company, called Citi Bike. The dataset contains user trip information for their company in New York City. We want to analyze this dataset to assist us with designing a new Citi Bike operation in another city. To do this, we will use Tableau to produce visualizations that break down the data into easy to see trends. 

## Results

* This visualization is a heat map that breaks down the busiest times of each day by gender. There is no real difference by gender, and this can be expected since commuting to and from work is the main driver behind this trend regardless of gender.

* The last visualization shows the most popular starting locations. All of the popular starting locations are in close proximity together, suggesting that the company should focus on adding more bikes to their busiest locations. 

## Summary 

* The majority of Citi Bike trips were by male subscribers that used the service to commute to and from work. There was no major differnce in usage between genders, other than there were less females that used the service in general. The analysis shows that the company may be missing out on subscribers, since there were a decent number of customers that used the service but were not subscribers. To look into this further, you could create visualizations that map the starting and stopping point of customers. These visualizations would help you see if there are areas of the city that you should focus your business on to help convert customers into subscribers.
